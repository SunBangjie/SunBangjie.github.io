As the emergence of virtual reality (VR), we observe an increasing trend in VR games, especially powered by commercial off-the-shelf VR headsets, such as HTC Vive. Apart from fast-pacing VR games like Fruit Ninja VR and FPS games like Robo Recall, we leverage the essence of VR - immersive and interactive experience - to design and develop a slow-pacing detective game, [***ByStanders***](https://qq315035253.wixsite.com/bystanders). Our work is inspired by PC games such as L.A. Noire (Team Bondi 2011), Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments (Frogwares 2014), Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (Spike Chunsoft 2016), and Kona (Parabole 2017).

*ByStanders* is a slow-paced puzzle-solving detective VR game background in the 1980s. Players can explore and look for clues to solve crimes by teleporting and interacting with surrounding objects. This game simulates reality by making most objects interactable and highly detailed models and textures, to provide immersive experience for players.
