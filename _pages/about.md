About Me
======

I am a passionate researcher in **computer vision**, and **sensing**. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in National University of Singapore (NUS). My supervisors are [Prof. Chan Mun Choon](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chanmc/) in National University of Singapore and [Prof. Jun Han](https://www.junhan.org/home) in KAIST. My research interests are in the intersection of computer vision and sensing systems.

Research Interests
======
- **Computer Vision**
- **Sensing and Mobile Systems**
- **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and CPS Security**

My research interests are in the intersection of **computer vision** and **sensing systems** to aid Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and security, as well as empower average users with the ***enhanced reality*** (i.e., capability of briding physical and digital worlds for daily activities to aid decision making, using only commodity devices). Specifically, my research focuses on augmenting computer vision techniques with physics models and other sensing modalities to solve a wide range of practical and real-world problems, including but not limited to enhancing public safety, verifying product authenticity, and protecting individual privacy.
