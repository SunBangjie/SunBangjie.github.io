About Me
======

I am a passionate researcher in **computer vision**, and **sensing**. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in National University of Singapore (NUS). My supervisors are [Prof. Chan Mun Choon](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chanmc/) in National University of Singapore and [Prof. Jun Han](https://www.junhan.org/home) in KAIST. My research interests are in the intersection of computer vision and sensing systems.

Research Interests
======
- **Computer Vision**
- **Mobile Sensing Systems**
- **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and CPS Security**
- **Knowledge-Driven AI**

My research interests are in the intersection of **computer vision** and **mobile sensing systems**, focusing on advancing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and addressing associated security and privacy challenges. Specifically, my research focuses on leveraging commodity cameras as a bridge between the cyber and physical worlds to address a broad range of real-world challenges and deliver tangible social benefits. This encompasses, but is not limited to, health protection, verifying the authenticity of physical and digital content, and safeguarding against privacy leaks. Additionally, my research also encompasses knowledge-guided machine and deep learning, with a focus on integrating scientific knowledge (e.g., physics priciples) to optimize models and transitioning from data-driven to knowledge-driven AI.
