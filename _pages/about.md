About Me
======

I am a passionate researcher in **computer vision**, and **sensing**. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in National University of Singapore (NUS). My supervisors are [Prof. Jun Han](https://www.junhan.org/home) in Yonsei University and [Prof. Chan Mun Choon](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chanmc/) in National University of Singapore. My research interests are in the intersection of computer vision and sensing systems.

Research Interests
======
- **Computer Vision**
- **Sensing and Mobile Systems**
- **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and CPS Security**

My research interests are in the intersection of **computer vision** and **sensing systems** to aid Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and security, as well as empower average users with the ***enhanced reality*** (i.e., capability of extracting hidden information in daily objects and activities to make decisions, using only commercial off-the-shelf devices). Specifically, my research focuses on augmenting computer vision techniques with physics models and other sensing modalities to extract physical properties of daily objects and activities.
